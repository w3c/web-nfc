    protocol for simple wireless interconnection of closely coupled devices
    operating at 13.56 MHz.
  </p>
  <p>
    The hardware standard is defined in [[[NFC-STANDARDS]]].

<section class="informative"> <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    Web NFC user scenario is as follows: Hold a device in close proximity to a
    passively powered NFC tag, such as a plastic card or sticker, in order to
    read and/or write data.
  </p>
  <p>
    NFC works using magnetic induction, meaning that the reader (an active,
    powered device) will emit a small electric charge which then creates a
    magnetic field.
    This field powers the passive device which turns it into electrical impulses
    to communicate data. Thus, when the devices are within range, a read is
    always performed (see NFC Analog Specification and NFC Digital Protocol, NFC
    Forum, 2006).
    The peer-to-peer connection works in a similar way, as the device
    periodically switches into a so-called initiator mode in order to scan for
    targets, then later to fall back into target mode. If a target is found, the
    data is read the same way as for tags.
  </p>
  <p>
    As NFC is based on existing RFID standards, many NFC chipsets support
    reading RFID tags, but some of these are only supported by single
    vendors and not part of the NFC standards. As such, this document
    specifies ways to interact with the NFC Data Exchange Format (NDEF).

    <b>NFC</b> stands for Near Field Communications, a short-range wireless
    technology operating at 13.56 MHz which enables communication between
    devices at a distance less than 10 cm. The NFC communications protocols and
    data exchange formats, and are based on existing radio-frequency
    identification (RFID) standards, including ISO/IEC 14443 and FeliCa.
    The NFC standards include ISO/IEC 18092[5] and those defined by the NFC

  <h2>The NFC Standard</h2>
  <p>
    NFC is standardized in the NFC Forum and described in [[NFC-STANDARDS]].
  </p>
  <section class="informative"> <h3>NDEF compatible tag types</h3>
    <p>
      The NFC Forum has mandated the support of five different tag types to be
      operable with NFC devices. The same is required on operating systems, such
      as Android.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to that, the <a>MIFARE Standard</a> specifies a way
      for NDEF to work on top of the older <a>MIFARE Standard</a>, which may
      be optionally supported by implementers.
    </p>
    <p>
      A note about the NDEF mapping can be found here:

          (Data Exchange Protocol defined in ISO/IEC 14443 (ISO/IEC 14443-4:2008
          Part 4: Transmission protocol). The tags are preconfigured

          that is accessible by long range RFID readers as well. The NFC communication
          is limited to short distance and may use the <i>Active Communication Mode</i> of
          ISO/IEC 18092 where the sending peer generates the field which balances
          power consumption and improves link stability. Variable memory, up to `64` kbytes.

  <h3>
    The NDEF record and fields
  </h3>
  <p>
    An <dfn>NDEF record</dfn> is a part of an <a>NDEF message</a>. Each record
    is a binary structure that contains a data payload, as well as associated
    type information. In addition to this, it includes information about how
    the data is structured, like payload size, whether the data is chunked over
    multiple records etc.
  </p>
  <div>
    A generic record looks like the following:
    <ndef-record class="ndef"
      header="*,*,*,*,*,*"
      content="*,PAYLOAD LENGTH - 1 (SR) to 4 bytes,ID LENGTH (optional),TYPE (optional),ID (optional),PAYLOAD (optional)">
    </ndef-record>
  </div>
  <p>
    Only the first three bytes (lines in figure) are mandatory. First the
    header byte, followed by the <a>TYPE LENGTH field</a> and <a>PAYLOAD
    LENGTH field</a>, both of which may be zero.
  </p>
  <div>
    The <dfn>TNF field</dfn> (bit `0-2`, type name format) indicates the format
    of the type name and is often exposed by native NFC software stacks. The
    field can take binary values denoting the following NDEF record payload types:
    <table class="simple">
      <tr>
        <th><strong>TNF value</strong></th>
        <th><strong>Description</strong></th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>0</td>
        <td><a>Empty record</a></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>NFC Forum [=well-known type record=]</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>2</td>
        <td><a>MIME type record</a></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>3</td>
        <td><a>Absolute-URL record</a></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>4</td>
        <td>NFC Forum <a>external type record</a></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>5</td>
        <td><a>Unknown record</a></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>6</td>
        <td><a>Unchanged record</a></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>7</td>
        <td>Reserved for future use</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </div>
  <p>
    The <dfn>IL field</dfn> (bit `3`, id length) indicates whether an
    <a>ID LENGTH field</a> is present. If the <a>IL field</a> is `0`, then the
    <a>ID field</a> is not present either.
  </p>
  <p>
    The <dfn>SR field</dfn> (bit `4`, short record) indicates a short record,
    one with a payload length <= `255` bytes. Normal records can have payload
    lengths exceeding `255` bytes up to a maximum of `4` GB. Short records only
    use one byte to indicate length, whether as normal records use `4` bytes
    (`2`<sup>`32`</sup>`-1` bytes).
  </p>
  <p>
    The <dfn>CF field</dfn> (bit `5`, chunk flag) indicates whether the payload
    is <a>chunked</a> across multiple records.
  </p>
  <p class="note">
    Web NFC turns all received chunked records into logical records and
    transparently chunks sent payload when that is needed.
  </p>
  <p>
    The <dfn>ME field</dfn> (bit `6`, message end) indicates whether this record
    is the last in the <a>NDEF message</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The <dfn>MB field</dfn> (bit `7`, message begin) indicates whether this
    record is the first of the <a>NDEF message</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The <dfn>TYPE LENGTH field</dfn> is an unsigned 8-bit integer that denotes
    the byte size of the <a>TYPE field</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The <dfn>TYPE field</dfn> is a globally unique and maintained identifier
    that describes the type of the <a>PAYLOAD field</a> in a structure,
    encoding and format dictated by value of the <a>TNF field</a>.
  </p>
  <p class="note">
    The [[[!NFC-RTD]]] requires that the <a>TYPE field</a> names MUST be
    compared in case-insensitive manner.
  </p>
  <p>
    The <dfn>ID LENGTH field</dfn> is an unsigned 8-bit integer that denotes
    the byte size of the <a>ID field</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The <dfn>ID field</dfn> is an identifier in the form of a URI reference
    ([[RFC3986]]) that is unique, and can be absolute of relative (in the
    latter case the application must provide a base URI). Middle and terminating
    chunk records MUST NOT have an <a>ID field</a>, other records MAY have it.
  </p>
  <p>
    The <dfn>PAYLOAD LENGTH field</dfn> denotes the byte size of the
    <a>PAYLOAD field</a>. If the <a>SR field</a> is `1`, its size is one byte,
    otherwise 4 bytes, representing an 8-bit or 32-bit unsigned integer,
    respectively.
  </p>
  <p>
    The <dfn>PAYLOAD field</dfn> carries the application bytes. Any internal
    structure of the data is opaque to NDEF. Note that in certain cases
    discussed later, this field MAY contain an <a>NDEF message</a> as data.

    <h4>
      Well-known type records (TNF 1)
    </h4>
    <p>
      The NFC Forum has standardized a small set of useful sub record types in
      [[NFC-RTD]] (Resource Type Definition specifications) called
      <dfn>well-known type record</dfn>s, for instance text, URL, media and others.
      In addition, there are record types designed for more
      complex interactions, such as smart posters (containing optional embedded
      records for url, text, signature and actions), and handover records.
    </p>
    <p>
      The type information stored in the <a>TYPE field</a> of
      <a>well-known type records</a> can be of two kinds:
      <a href="#well-known-local-types">local types</a>
      and <a href="#well-known-global-types">global types</a>.
    </p>

    <section><h4>Well-known local types</h4>
      <p>
        NFC Forum <dfn>local type</dfn> that are defined by the NFC Forum or
        by an application, and always start with lowercase character or a
        number. Those are usually short strings that are unique only within
        the local context of the containing record. They are used when the
        meaning of the types doesn't matter outside of the local context of the
        containing record and when storage usage is a hard constraint. See
        <a>Smart poster</a> for an example on how local types are used.
      </p>
      <p class="note">
        A [=local type=] is thus defined in terms of a containing record type,
        and thus doesn't need any namespacing. For this reason the same local
        type name can be used within another record type with different meaning
        and different payload type.
      </p>
    </section>
    </section>  <!-- Well-known (TNF 1) types -->

    <section><h4>Well-known global types</h4>
      <p>
        NFC Forum <dfn>global type</dfn>s are defined and managed by the
        NFC Forum and usually start with an uppercase character.
        Examples: "`T`" for text, "`U`" for URL, "`Sp`" for smart poster,
        "`Sig`" for signature, "`Hc`" for handover carrier, "`Hr`" for
        handover request, "`Hs`" for handover select, etc.
      </p>

    <section> <h5>Text record</h5>
      <div>
        The <dfn>Text record</dfn> is a [=well-known type record=] that is defined
        in the [[NDEF-TEXT]] specification.
        The <a>TNF field</a> is `1` and the <a>TYPE field</a> is "`T`" (`0x54`).
        The first byte of the <a>PAYLOAD field</a> is a status byte, followed
        by the [=language tag=] in US-ASCII encoding.
        The rest of the payload is the actual text, encoded either in UTF-8 or
        UTF-16, as indicated by the status byte as follows:
        <ul>
          <li>Bits 0 to 5 define the length of the [=language tag=].</li>
          <li>Bit 6 is `0`.</li>
          <li>
            If bit 7 if set, means the payload is encoded in UTF-8, otherwise in
            UTF-16.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section> <h5>URI record</h5>
      <p>
        <dfn>URI record</dfn> is defined in [[NDEF-URI]].
        The <a>TNF field</a> is `1` and the <a>TYPE field</a> is "`U`" (`0x55`).
        The first byte of the <a>PAYLOAD field</a> is a URI identifier code,
        in fact an index in an abbreviation table where the values are prepended
        to the rest of the URI. For instance the value `0` denotes no prepending,
        `1` denotes "`http://www.`", `0x04` denotes "`https://`"" and so on.
        The rest of the payload contains the rest of the URI as a UTF-8 string
        (and if the first byte is `0`, then it denotes the whole URI).
      </p>
      <p>
        The URI is defined in [[RFC3987]] and in fact is a UTF-8 encoded IRI
        that can be a URN or a URL.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section> <h5>Smart poster record</h5>
    <div>
      <dfn>Smart poster</dfn> is defined in [[NDEF-SMARTPOSTER]] to describe a
      given web content as an NDEF record that contains an <a>NDEF message</a>
      as payload, including the following records:
      <ul>
        <li>
          A single mandatory <a>URI record</a> that refers to the
          <a>smart poster</a> content.
          <p class="note">
            The [[NDEF-SMARTPOSTER]] states that applications SHALL use only the
            <a>smart poster</a> record if it is present in an <a>NDEF message</a>
            that also contains other <a>URI records</a>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          Zero or more <a>Text records</a> that act as a <dfn>title record</dfn>
          related to the content. When there are more than one title record
          present, they MUST be with different <a>language tags</a>.
          Applications SHOULD select one <a>title record</a> for presentation
          to the end user.
        </li>
        <li>
          Zero or more <a>MIME type records</a> that act as <dfn>icon record</dfn>
          related to the content. The <a>MIME type</a> is usually "`image/jpg`",
          "`image/png`", "`image/gif`", or even "`video/mpeg`".
          Applications SHOULD select one <a>icon record</a> for presentation
          to the end user.
        </li>
        <li>
          One optional <dfn>type record</dfn> that has a [=local type name=]
          "`t`" specific to <a>smart poster</a> and the <a>PAYLOAD field</a>
          contains a UTF-8 encoded MIME type for the content referred to by the
          <a>URI record</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
          One optional <dfn>size record</dfn> that has [=local type name=] "`s`"
          specific to <a>smart poster</a> and the <a>PAYLOAD field</a> contains
          a 4-byte 32 bit unsigned integer that denotes the size of the object
          referred to by the URL in the <a>URI record</a> of the
          <a>smart poster</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
          One optional <dfn>action record</dfn> that has a [=local type name=]
          "`act`" specific to <a>smart poster</a> and the <a>PAYLOAD field</a>
          contains a single byte, whose value has the following meaning:
          <table class="simple">
            <tr>
              <th><strong>Value</strong></th>
              <th><strong>Description</strong></th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>0</td>
              <td>Do the action</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>1</td>
              <td>Save for later</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>2</td>
              <td>Open for editing</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>3..0xFF</td>
              <td>Reserved for future use</td>
            </tr>
          </table>
          There is no default action on the <a>smart poster</a> content if the
          <a>action record</a> is missing.
          <p class="note">
            At the time of NDEF standardization the value `0` ("do the action") was
            intended for use cases like send an SMS, make a call or launch browser.
            Similarly, the value `1`, ("save the content for later processing") was
            intended for use cases like store the SMS in inbox, save the URL in
            bookmarks, or save the phone number to contacts. Also, the value `2`
            ("open for editing") was meant to open the smart poster content with a
            default application for editing.
          </p>
          <p>
            Implementations don't need to implement any standardized behavior for the
            actions defined here. In this API it's up to the applications what actions
            they define (that may include the use cases above). However, Web NFC
            just provides the values.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          A <a>smart poster</a> MAY also contain other records, which can be
          handled in an application specific manner.

      The <dfn>unchanged record</dfn>s are record chunks of

      A <dfn>chunked</dfn> payload is spread across multiple <a>NDEF record</a>s
      that undergo the following rules:
      <ul>
        <li>
          The initial chunk record has the <a>CF field</a> set, its

    <p>
      An NFC reader works by polling, so in order to be able to
      write to a tag or making it permanently read-only, a tag first needs to
      be found and read, which means that polling needs to be initialized
      first.
    </p>
    <p>
      If polling is not initiated already by first calling `scan()`,
      then the `write()` and `makeReadOnly()` methods will initiate it
      temporarily until a tag was found and read, and the operation was
      attempted.
    </p>
    <p>
      This means that the flow is that first a read is performed
      as the tag is first found, then followed by a writing operation.
    </p>
    <p>
      This means that if `scan()` is running and you have an event
      listener for the `reading` event, it will be dispatched once
      during a `write()` or `makeReadOnly()` operation, which might not be the
      intended behavior.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the following sections we will discuss how you can easily
      deal with this behavior, but first a few simple examples.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section><h3>Write a text string</h3>
    <p>
      Writing a text string to an NFC tag is straightforward.
    </p>
    <pre class="example">
      const ndef = new NDEFReader();
      ndef.write(
        "Hello World"
      ).then(() => {
        console.log("Message written.");
      }).catch(error => {
        console.log(`Write failed :-( try again: ${error}.`);
      });
    </pre>
  </section>

  <section> <h3>Write a URL</h3>
    <p>
      In order to write an NDEF record of URL type, simply use NDEFMessage. Here
      we rely on async/await.
    </p>
    <pre class="example">
      const ndef = new NDEFReader();
      try {
        await ndef.write({
          records: [{ recordType: "url", data: "https://w3c.github.io/web-nfc/" }]
        });
      } catch {
        console.log("Write failed :-( try again.");
      };
    </pre>
  </section>

  <section> <h3>Handling initial reads while writing</h3>
    <p>
      In order to write, a tag needs to be found and thus read. This gives
      you the ability to check whether it is actually a tag that you want to
      write to or not, by checking existing data or serial number.
    </p>
    <p>
      For this reason, it is recommended calling `write()` from a `reading`
      event. Same applies to `makeReadOnly()`.
    </p>
      The below example shows how to coordinate between a common `reading`
      handler and one used specifically for a single write.
    </p>
    <pre class="example">
      const ndef = new NDEFReader();
      let ignoreRead = false;

      ndef.onreading = (event) => {
        if (ignoreRead) {
          return; // write pending, ignore read.
        }

        console.log("We read a tag, but not during pending write!");
      };

      function write(data) {
        ignoreRead = true;
        return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
          ndef.addEventListener("reading", event => {
            // Check if we want to write to this tag, or reject.
            ndef.write(data).then(resolve, reject).finally(() => ignoreRead = false);
          }, { once: true });
        });
      }

      await ndef.scan();
      try {
        await write("Hello World");
        console.log("We wrote to a tag!")
      } catch(err) {
        console.error("Something went wrong", err);
      }
    </pre>
  </section>

  <section> <h3>Scheduling a write with a timeout</h3>
    <p>
      It can sometimes be useful to set a time limit on a write operation.
      Like you ask the user to touch a tag, and if no tag is found within
      a certain amount of time, then you time out.
    </p>
    <pre class="example">
      const ndef = new NDEFReader();
      ndef.onreading = (event) => console.log("We read a tag!");

      function write(data, { timeout } = {}) {
        return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
          const ctlr = new AbortController();
          ctlr.signal.onabort = () => reject("Time is up, bailing out!");
          setTimeout(() => ctlr.abort(), timeout);

          ndef.addEventListener("reading", event => {
            ndef.write(data, { signal: ctlr.signal }).then(resolve, reject);
          }, { once: true });
        });
      }

      await ndef.scan();
      try {
        // Let's wait for 5 seconds only.
        await write("Hello World", { timeout: 5_000 });
      } catch(err) {
        console.error("Something went wrong", err);
      } finally {
        console.log("We wrote to a tag!");
      }
    </pre>
  </section>

  <section> <h3>Handle scanning errors</h3>
    <p>
      This example shows what happens when {{NDEFReader/scan}} promise rejects and
      `readingerror` is fired.
    </p>
    <pre class="example">
      const ndef = new NDEFReader();
      ndef.scan().then(() => {
        console.log("Scan started successfully.");
        ndef.onreadingerror = (event) => {
          console.log("Error! Cannot read data from the NFC tag. Try a different one?");
        };
        ndef.onreading = (event) => {
          console.log("NDEF message read.");
        };
      }).catch(error => {
        console.log(`Error! Scan failed to start: ${error}.`);
      });
    </pre>
  </section>

  <section> <h3>Read a single tag, once</h3>
    <p>
      This example show you how to easily create a convenience function
      that just reads a single tag and then stops polling, saving
      battery life by cutting unneeded work.
    </p>
    <p>
      The example could easily be extended to time out after a given
      amount of milliseconds.
    </p>
    <pre class="example">
      const ndef = new NDEFReader();

      function read() {
        return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
          const ctlr = new AbortController();
          ctlr.signal.onabort = reject;
          ndef.addEventListener("reading", event => {
            ctlr.abort();
            resolve(event);
          }, { once: true });
          ndef.scan({ signal: ctlr.signal }).catch(err => reject(err));
        });
      }

      read().then(({ serialNumber }) => {
        console.log(serialNumber);
      });
    </pre>
  </section>

  <section> <h3>Read data from tag, and write to empty ones</h3>
    <p>
      This example shows reading various different kinds of data which can be
      stored on a tag. If the tag is unformatted or contains an empty record,
      a text message is written with the value "Hello World".
    </p>
    <pre class="example">
      const ndef = new NDEFReader();
      await ndef.scan();
      ndef.onreading = async ({ message }) => {
        if (message.records.length == 0 ||               // unformatted tag
            message.records[0].recordType == "empty") {  // empty record
          await ndef.write({
            records: [{ recordType: "text", data: "Hello World" }]
          });
          return;
        }

        const decoder = new TextDecoder();
        for (const record of message.records) {
          switch (record.recordType) {
            case "text":
              const textDecoder = new TextDecoder(record.encoding);
              console.log(`Text: ${textDecoder.decode(record.data)} (${record.lang})`);
              break;
            case "url":
              console.log(`URL: ${decoder.decode(record.data)}`);
              break;
            case "mime":
              if (record.mediaType === "application/json") {
                console.log(`JSON: ${JSON.parse(decoder.decode(record.data))}`);
              }
              else if (record.mediaType.startsWith("image/")) {
                const blob = new Blob([record.data], { type: record.mediaType });

                const img = document.createElement("img");
                img.src = URL.createObjectURL(blob);
                img.onload = () => window.URL.revokeObjectURL(this.src);

                document.body.appendChild(img);
              }
              else {
                console.log(`Media not handled`);
              }
              break;
            default:
              console.log(`Record not handled`);
          }
        }
      };

  <section> <h3>Save and restore game progress with an NFC tag</h3>
    <p>
      Filtering of relevant data sources can be done by the use of
      a custom record identifier, in this case "`/my-game-progress`".
      When we read the data, we immediately update the game progress by issuing
      a write with a custom NDEF data layout.

      await ndef.scan();

  <section> <h3>Read an external record with an NDEF message as payload</h3>
    <p>
      External type records can be used to create application defined records.
      These records may contain an <a>NDEF message</a> as payload,
      with its own <a>NDEF records</a>, including <a>local types</a> that are
      used in the context of the application.

    <p>
      Note that the <a>smart poster</a> record type also contains an
      <a>NDEF message</a> as payload.
    </p>
    <p>
      As NDEF gives no guarantee on the ordering of records, using
      an external type record with an <a>NDEF message</a> as payload,
      can be useful for encapsulating related data.

      <p class=note>
        The NFC NDEF specifications uses the terms "message identifier" and "payload identifier"

      A <dfn>language tag</dfn> is a <a>string</a> that matches the

      <dfn>subtags</dfn> that are delimited by a U+002D HYPHEN-MINUS ("-").
      For example, the '<code>en-AU</code>' language range represents
      English as spoken in Australia, and '<code>fr-CA</code>' represents
      French as spoken in Canada. Language tags that meet the validity
      criteria of [[RFC5646]] section 2.2.9 that can be verified without

    <h2>The <dfn>record type</dfn> string</h2>
      <p>
        This string defines the allowed record types for an <a>NDEFRecord</a>. The
        [[[#data-mapping]]] section describes how it is mapped to
        <a>NDEF record</a> types.
      </p>
      <p>
        A standardized <dfn>well known type name</dfn> can be one of the
        following:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt>The "<dfn>empty</dfn>" string</dt>
        <dd>
          The value representing an <a href="#empty-ndef-record-tnf-0">empty</a>
          <a>NDEFRecord</a>.
        </dd>
        <dt>The "<dfn>text</dfn>" string</dt>
        <dd>
          The value representing a <a>Text record</a>.
        </dd>
        <dt>The "<dfn>url</dfn>" string</dt>
        <dd>
          The value representing a <a>URI record</a>.
        </dd>
        <dt>The "<dfn>smart-poster</dfn>" string</dt>
        <dd>
          The value representing a <a>Smart poster</a> record.
        </dd>
        <dt>The "<dfn>absolute-url</dfn>" string</dt>
        <dd>
          The value representing an <a>absolute-URL record</a>.
        </dd>
        <dt>The "<dfn>mime</dfn>" string</dt>
        <dd>
          The value representing a <a>MIME type record</a>.
        </dd>
        <dt>The "<dfn>unknown</dfn>" string</dt>
        <dd>
          The value representing an <a>unknown record</a>.
        </dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        In addition to [=well known type names=] it is also possible for
        organizations to create a custom <dfn>external type name</dfn>,
        which is a string consisting of a [=domain=] name and a custom type name,
        separated by a colon `U+003A` (`:`).
      </p>
      <p>
        Applications MAY also use a <dfn>local type name</dfn>, which is a
        string that MUST start with lowercase character or a number,
        representing a type for an NFC Forum [=local type=]. It is
        typically used in a record of an <a>NDEFMessage</a> that is the payload
        of a parent <a>NDEFRecord</a>, for instance in a <a>smart poster</a>.
        The context of the <a>local type</a> is the parent record whose payload
        is the <a>NDEFMessage</a> to which this record belongs and the
        <a>local type name</a> SHOULD NOT conflict with any other type names
        used in that context.
      </p>
      <p>
        Any implementation of Web NFC MUST transparently expose chunked records
        as single logical records, therefore <a>unchanged record</a>s are not
        explicitly represented.
      </p>
      <p>
        Two <a>well-known type records</a> (including any NFC Forum
        <a>local type</a> and any NFC Forum <a>global type</a>) MUST be compared
        character by character in case-sensitive manner.
      </p>
      <p>
        Two external types MUST be compared character by character, in
        case-insensitive manner.
      </p>
      <p>
        The binary representation of any <a>well-known type record</a> and
        <a>external type</a> MUST be written as a relative URI (RFC 3986),
        omitting the namespace identifier (NID) "`nfc`" and namespace specific
        string (NSS) "`wkt`" and "`ext`", respectively, i.e. omitting the
        "`urn:nfc:wkt:`" and "`urn:nfc:ext:`" prefixes.
        For instance, "`urn:nfc:ext:company.com:a" is stored as "`company.com:a`"
        and the <a>well-known type records</a> of a <a>Text record</a> is
        "`urn:nfc:wkt:T`", but it is stored as "`T`".

    <section><h3>Validating external type</h3>
      <div>
        The [[NFC-RTD]] specifies that external types MUST contain
        the [=domain=] name of the issuing organization, a colon `U+003A` (`:`)
        and a type name that is at least one character long, for instance
        "`w3.org:member`".
      </div>
      <p>
        The [[NFC-RTD]] specifies the URN prefix “`urn:nfc:ext:`” as well, but
        it is not stored in the <a>NDEF record</a>, therefore Web NFC
        applications SHOULD NOT specify the URN prefix when creating
        <a>external type records</a>.
      </p>
      <p class="note">
        The [[NFC-RTD]] requires that external type names are represented
        with the URN prefix “`urn:nfc:ext:`”, e.g. when reading
        <a>NDEF messages</a>. However, since <a>external type records</a> are
        distinguished by having the <a>TNF FIELD</a> set to `0x04`, there is
        no risk seen for type name clashing. Also, there are
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/URNsAndRegistries-50.html">
        W3C TAG recommendations</a> to avoid using URNs in the Web.
        Therefore, Web NFC does not use the URN prefix neither when reading
        or writing <a>NDEF messages</a>.

      The Unicode standard defines multiple encodings like UTF-8, UTF-16 and UTF-32.
      UTF-8 is the preferred encoding on the web, and it has the advantage
      that it is endianness agnostic, as [=code points=] are represented in single bytes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The NDEF text records allow the text to be encoded as either UTF-8 or UTF-16.
      Generally, it is preferred to use UTF-8 encoding on the web, but integration
      with existing systems may require UTF-16.
    </p>
    <p>
      The data transmission order and thus the byte order of NDEF is
      defined as big endian (BE) in [[[NFC-NDEF]]], which means that everything is read back with big endian byte ordering.
    </p>
    <p>
      For UTF-16, byte order matters as it might differ between reading and writing
      due to each [=code point=] spanning two bytes. For this reason UTF-16 encoded text
      usually contains a byte order mark (also known as BOM), which is written as
      `0xFEFF`. This means that if the byte order differs between host machine and
      NDEF, then the value will be read back as `0xFFFE`, indicating that the byte
      order should be swapped. The [[[ENCODING]]] differentiates UTF-16 as UTF-16BE
      (big endian) and UTF-16LE (little endian) depending on the byte order.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the case that no byte order mark is present, UTF-16BE encoding should be assumed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Using the <a data-cite="encoding#decoder">decoder</a> with `encoding` set to
      `utf-16`, it will automatically detect whether bytes should be swapped in
      case the byte order mark is present. `utf-16be` can be used to read as big
      endian in case there is no byte order mark.
    </p>
    <p>
      Using the <a data-cite="encoding#encoder">encoder</a>, it is only possible
      to encode as UTF-8, so if UTF-16 is needed, it will have to be encoded
      manually or by using a library.

<!-- - - - - - - - - - - - - Security and Privacy - - - - - - - - - - - - - -->
<section> <h2 id="security">Security and Privacy</h2>
  <section> <h3>Chain of trust</h3>
    <p>
      Implementations need to make sure that when the user authorizes a method which is part of the Web NFC API, only that action is run, without side effects.
    </p>
    <p>
      By default, NDEF doesn't provide any way to make the content trusted
      beyond allowing tags to be made permanently read-only after writing
      data to them. This can even be done from a factory setting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Data written by the use of this API is not signed or encrypted automatically,
      which follows existing native NFC APIs. In order to protect the
      integrity and authenticity of NDEF messages, the NFC Forum introduced
      [[NDEF-SIGNATURE]]. Using <a>NDEF signature</a> and
      key management is the responsibility of the application.
    </p>
    <p>
      For trusting the <strong>confidentiality</strong> of the data exchanged
      via NFC, applications may use encrypted <a>NFC content</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      For trusting the <strong>integrity</strong> of the data exchanged via NFC,
      applications may use an <a>NDEF signature</a>, with key management based
      on Public Key Infrastructure (PKI).
    </p>
    <p>
      Security considerations for MIME types in general are discussed in
      [[RFC2048]] and [[RFC2046]].
    </p>
  </section>
  <section> <h3>Privacy implications and implementation considerations</h3>
    <p>
      The comparison to barcodes or QR codes is appropriate because NFC tags
      are another non-human-readable method of exchanging data and sharing
      them can have unforeseen privacy and security implications. For a web
      site to read a QR code, a piece of interruptive UI must be used (the
      camera) which captures an image and makes it apparent that the contents
      of this image (including the QR code) will be available to the web page,
      making it clear to the user that scanning is being performed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scanning a tag with NFC requires the user to place the scanning device
      (e.g. phone) in close proximity to the NFC tag - usually 5-10 cm, 2-4
      inches.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scanning a tag when a Web NFC scan is not active, triggers the host OS
      handling. Thus launching URLs and apps from scanning a NFC tag is not
      handled and supported by Web NFC itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Furthermore, Web NFC scanning needs to be activated from a user interaction,
      and scanning is paused when the web site is not in focus or the device
      screen turns off (i.e. is not unlocked). This is put in place so that
      accidental scans are not likely to happen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Web NFC further recommends that the implementation makes it very clear
      UX-wise to the user that data will be scanned when placing the scanning
      device in close proximity to a NFC tag - basically mimicking the UX flow
      of scanning a QR code.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are many options for doing so, like playing back a sound or showing
      some persistent UI while the scanning can happen, for instance a modal
      dialog with the ability to cancel at any point.
    </p>
    <img class="illustration" src="images/scan.jpg">
    <p>
      An implementation could also show the data that is about to be uploaded,
      postpone sharing the read data until the user OK'd it and even show some
      UI allowing the user to select which records to share.
    </p>
    <img class="illustration" src="images/approve.jpg">
    <section> <h4>Reading and writing during a scan</h4>
      <p>
       When the user scans a tag, at that point the web application has access
       to read the data on the tag, and in case it is not read-only, also to
       write data to the tag. Consumer stickers for private usage (e.g. in the
       maker community) are often unlocked (read + write), whereas commercial
       deployment of NFC are read-only.
      </p>
      <p class="note">
        An older protocol SNEP (Simple NDEF Exchange Protocol) allowed active
        devices (e.g. a phone) to receive NDEF data from another active device,
        but it is unsupported by Web NFC and it is currently being deprecated
        on supported native platforms.
      </p>
      <p class="note">

        furthermore it has restrictions on what input to accept and the IOT device
        must ensure that the accepted records are valid.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the tag contains privacy sensitive data, such data will be shared with
        the site. Potentially, not immediately if the UX requires the user to
        confirm the data exchange before doing so.
      </p>
      <p>
        In some cases it might be obvious that the tag/device contains privacy
        sensitive data, say in case of NFC equipped conference badgets and business
        cards. This would also be the case with an NFC equipped glucose meter,
        which can indicate that you, or someone in the close family, are a diabetes
        patient.
      </p>
      <p>
        In other cases it might be less obvious that that can happen, but a user
        might have used an app or website to write data to a tag that unknowingly
        to the user encoded a user id or the like, which can later be read back
        by any other site.
      </p>
      <p>
        Private and unexpected data can also be stored in files (e.g. word
        pressing documents, PDFs or camera images) which are uploaded using
        the file upload API. The mitigations associated with the Web NFC API
        are stronger than those associated with file upload and the data less
        likely to be personally identifiable.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section> <h4>Reading and writing during a scan</h4>
      <p>
        A scan of a tag might also reveal user location if the website knows
        how to identify the tag and know the tags location in the real world,
        like if it is mounted inside a museum. It might also be able to deduct
        it somewhat as for instance FeliCa NFC tags are mostly used in Japan,
        but Web NFC doesn’t reveal what tag technology is used.
      </p>
      <p>
        This does not bring the web advertising and tracking model into the
        real world, because it requires an action by the user and it cannot
        be triggered in the background; and with proper UX it should be clear
        that scanning is active.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section> <h4>Overwriting existing data</h4>
      <p>
        There is also the fear that writing to a NFC tag can ruin it or
        “brick it”. As NFC tags were designed to be read by multiple user
        applications, NDEF tags have been designed with an easy way to make
        devices permanently read-only and can even be configured that way
        from a factory.
      </p>
      <p>
        NDEF is a simple exchange format for reading and writing data and
        not for bi-directional communication. NFC supports multiple
        communications formats based on lower tech (thus not locked as
        read-only as NDEF) and none of these are supported by Web NFC.
      </p>
    </section>

  <section> <h3>Things that users should be made aware of when using NFC</h3>
    <p>
      This section details some of the things that users ought to be aware
      of when using NFC. It is recommendated that implementations help educate
      the users of given facts before or when related NFC actions are performed.
    </p>
    <h4>Data that is read is shared with site</h4>
    <p>
      When a site has access to read NFC content, then the data of the scanned
      tags is shared with the site, in a similar way to uploading files and images.
      As with any site, it is up to the user whether to trust that the site handles this data properly and in the
      intended manner.
    </p>
    <h4>A site may modify and overwrite data of tags that are not made read-only</h4>
    <p>
      Deployed NFC solutions, like tags in stores etc, should always be made
      read-only in order to ensure they are not modified by mistake or as part
      of a malicious act.
    </p>
    <p>
      Private tags and stickers are often unlocked (writable) from the factory
      and the user should be aware that such tags might be overwritten/modified
      by scanning them.
    </p>
    <h4>Reading a fixed (e.g. mounted) tag may expose reading location</h4>
    <p>
      A fixed tag may encode its ID or location in the data, meaning that reading
      it exposes that information to the site that knows the physical location of the tag, which then can deduct the location
      the read took place. That combined with being logged into a service, can
      share your location data with the site.
    </p>
    <p>
      Data written is readable by other apps and sites with granted read access
      Any NDEF data on a tag can be read by any app or web site with the proper
      access, so if that is not intended then the data should be encrypted in a
      secure manner that only who is supposed to read it can.
    </p>
    <h4>Multiple tags may be within the reading field at the same time</h4>
    <p>
      NFC can only read one tag at the time, but multiple tags can be detected
      and one of the tags can be selected as the tag to communicate with.
    </p>
    <p>
      Use cases for this could be having multiple smart cards (NFC based) in
      your wallet and not wanting to take the card out.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is mostly useful for payment cards and travel cards that are read
      by external hardware and thus not a use-case for Web NFC. For Web NFC,
      we do not allow reading when there are multiple tags available, preventing the following attack vector.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is an attack vector, where someone places another malicious NFC
      tag/sticker on top of a legitimate tag, in order to load the wrong
      app/site, or inject wrong data into the right app/site. They can
      do so by cloning the data of the original tag and modifying it -
      either by changing the URL to load a malicious app/site, or by
      changing the data to inject malicious data in the right app/site.
      Example: the tag is supposed to take you to <a href="https://example.com">https://example.com</a> but is modified
      to take you to <a href="https://exаmple.com">https://exаmple.com</a> (that is with a Cyrillic а) - it looks legitimate
      and you might now to giving sensitive data to a malicious site.
    </p>
    <p>
      Loading web sites from a tag is outside the scope of Web NFC, but it
      is recommended for user agents to not auto load URLs when multiple
      tags are available due to the above attack vector.
    </p>
    <p>
      By disallowing reading when there are multiple tags available, Web
      NFC protects well against injecting wrong/malicious data into a site
      as shielding the existing NFC tag is quite difficult as it requires
      ferrite shielding which is quite visible. Metal interferes with the
      magnetic field and makes tags not readable.

  <section class="informative"> <h2>Assets</h2>
    <div>
      Assets to be protected include the following:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>NDEF message</strong> as a whole,
          <strong>NDEF records</strong> (including payload and header) in
          particular, either in-transfer or in-storage state,
          when they are being overwritten by a Web NFC triggered operation,
          against data disclosure and data modification.
          This also includes Denial of Service attacks against a solution
          deployed with NFC tags (e.g. a malicious actor destroying tags linked
          to a solution).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>User identity or other privacy sensitive attributes</strong>
          that can be directly or indirectly determined by using Web NFC, by the
          <a>NFC content</a> creator, or by a web site using Web NFC.
          This data could be used directly or leaked forward to third parties.
          Examples are user location, device identifiers and user identifiers.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>User data</strong> exposed to a web page using Web NFC.
          While a web page might collect user data using other means than
          Web NFC, it might embed this data into NDEF records and share via
          Web NFC.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Integrity of user device</strong>.
          A read of an NFC tag might result in a user device compromise
          that can further lead to loss of other web NFC or platform assets.

      The following attacker patterns have been considered:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Malicious web page creator</strong>: phishing user data,
          identity or other privacy sensitive attributes, destroying or
          modifying NFC tags to cause further damage through fake identities
          and attack vectors.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Malicious NFC tag creator</strong>: same as above, but with the
          additional possibility to create, delete or modify the NFC
          tags locally.
          As a result can compromise integrity of user device, cause data
          injection, redirect to malicious web page, phishing user location,
          causing side actions such as installing applications, trigger
          automated dispatching or other actions.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Compromised device or user agent: man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack</strong>:
          any MITM style attack between Web NFC implementation and an <a>NFC adapter</a>
          in a user device, including attempts to interact with a web site using

          Implementations need security hardening.
          Involuntary touch is low probability due to short range and critical
          angle for reading, and due to the focus requirements.
          Automatic actions for smart posters and other tags should not be
          allowed. The user must be made aware and given the ability to control
          what is happening during the NFC communication. For instance, opening
          content from <a>smart poster</a>, automatic connection to (possibly
          malicious) WiFi via <a>NFC handover</a>, etc.

        applications may use encrypted <a>NFC content</a> with key management
        based on Public Key Infrastructure (PKI).
        Key management is out of the scope of Web NFC.

      <p>
        For tags signed with <a>NDEF signature</a> version 1.0 ([[NFC-SECURITY]]),

      <p>
        Only <a>secure contexts</a> are allowed to access <a>NFC content</a>.
        Browsers MAY ignore this rule for development purposes only.
      </p>

    <section> <h4>Visible document</h4>
      <p>
        Web NFC functionality is allowed only for the {{Document}} of the

        {{Document/visibilityState}} is `"visible"`.
      </p>
      <p>
        This also means that UAs should block access to the NFC radio if
        the display is off or the device is locked.
        For backgrounded web pages, receiving and writing <a>NFC content</a>
        must be <a id="#nfc-suspended">suspended</a>.

    <section> <h4>Warn about risk of physical location leak</h4>
      <p>
        When listening for and writing <a>NFC content</a>,
        the UA MAY warn the user that the given <a>origin</a> may be able to
        infer physical location.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section> <h4>Restrict automatic handling</h4>
      <p>
        When the payload data on <a>NFC content</a> is untrusted, it MUST NOT
        be used by the UA to do automatic handling of the content, such as
        opening a web page with a URL found in an <a>NFC tag</a>, or installing

    <section> <h4>Signing <a>NFC content</a></h4>
      <div>
        The following policies are recommended to be implemented by applications.
        <ul>
          <li>
            A <a>smart poster</a> MAY be trusted only if signed by using
            a single <a>NDEF signature</a> record by the same issuer and
            it is either the first record in a message, or it is preceded by
            another <a>NDEF signature</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
            An <a>NDEF message</a> MAY be trusted only if signed by
            a single <a>NDEF signature</a> record by the same issuer.
          </li>
          <li>
            User agents expose <a>NDEF signature</a> records without verifying
            them. It is applications' responsibility to verify signatures and
            to sign <a>NFC content</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Applications SHOULD use appropriate signature algorithms,
            certificates and security policies for <a>NDEF signature</a>
            creation and verification. Also, take into account the known
            attacks agains <a>NDEF signature</a>s, for instance removing
            <a>NDEF signature</a>, replacing <a>NDEF signature</a> along with
             modifying the <a>NFC content</a>, reordering records by changing
             the record <a>PAYLOAD LENGTH field</a>, etc.
          </li>
        </ul>
