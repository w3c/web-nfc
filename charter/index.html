<section><h2>Goals</h2>
  <p>
    Near-field communication (NFC) is a form of short range wireless
    communication in which NFC devices such as mobile phones can communicate
    with each other over a typical distance of 4cm or less. NFC allows for two
    way communication. The NFC Forum defines base standards for how smart cards
    are emulated by NFC devices and NFC Forum tags are formatted and the
    protocols for communicating between devices. There are three modes of
    operation:
    <ul>
      <li>read/write mode - the NFC device can read or write records, each of
      which has a type. There are currently several defined record types (Text,
      URI, Smart Poster, etc.). Records can be set to read-only, and protected
      through encryption and digital signatures.</li>
      <li>peer to peer mode - where two NFC devices exchange data, for example,
      data for setting up WiFi access, or data representing a business card.
      </li>
      <li>card emulation mode - where an NFC device emulates a smart card, e.g.
      allowing an NFC enabled phone to be used for contactless ticketing and
      payment applications. Emulated cards may have limited storage
      capabilities, e.g. the MiFare Classic 1K with 1024 bytes of data storage
      split across 16 sectors.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>
    The main benefit of NFC is the speed and simplicity of operation for end
    users. Touch a card to a reader to pay for ride on the metro. Touch an NFC
    phone to a tag on a poster to view the web site for the associated event.
    Touch two NFC phones together to exchange business cards.
  </p>

  <p>
    In some cases no set up is needed as the card's record type is recognized
    by the NFC device's operating system, which automatically launches the
    appropriate application, such as the web browser. In other cases, as in
    peer to peer mode, the device will first need to run the corresponding
    application, which may involve asking the user to select what information
    to share.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Web Near Field Communication Community Group will define an API for Web
    page scripts to use the NFC data exchange format and APDUs, enabling a
    range of use cases for reading, writing, emulating cards and data exchange
    with peer NFC devices. Further background information can be found on the
    NFC Wiki.
  </p>
</section>

<section><h2>Scope of Work</h2>
  <p>
    The goal is to provide a Web NFC API that satisfies the most important use
    cases for NFC from Web pages. We believe that means that the API will not
    expose full, low level NFC functionality, but rather a higher level subset
    that is safe for Web pages, protects user privacy, and doesn't annoy users
    with unnecessary or complex permission requests.
  </p>
  <p>
    The scope of the Web Near Field Communications Community Group is limited to
    the development of APIs for Web page scripts to perform the following
    operations with NFC devices:
    <ul>
      <li>Reading NDEF messages</li>
      <li>Writing NDEF messages</li>
      <li> Setting NFC tags to read-only</li>
      <li> Peer to peer exchange of NDEF messages between NFC devices</li>
      <li>Optionally, manual connection for various technologies, e.g. NFC-A
        and NFC-F</li>
      <li>Optionally, initiation of NFC Card emulation mode for NFC devices,
        to allow the use of a device for payments or for unlocking electronic
        door locks.</li>
      <li> Optionally, initiation of handover mode to Bluetooth or WiFi
      technology.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    The APIs will be designed to permit execution in the Web browser context,
    using the security model of the Web. The very short range of NFC devices
    requires users to make a conscious decision to put one of the devices into
    the appropriate mode and to bring the devices physically together, and
    this should enable a simpler security model that minimizes the need for
    applications to ask for explicit user permission. The need for direct user
    involvement under circumstances will need to be explored.
  </p>
  <p>
    The CG will explore permission models that take advantage of the
    physical properties of the NFC connection to align user expectations with
    the permissions actually granted to script. Aspects of the environment that
    might go into the permission model include:
    <ul>
      <li>Whether the script is running in the frontmost tab or window.</li>
      <li>Whether the script is running in an open tab or window (vs. a Service
        Worker)</li>
      <li>Whether the script has been vouched for by a trusted authority, such
        as applications installed from a store or shipped with a device.</li>
      <li>The user's interactions with permission and choice prompts.</li>
      <li>Preferences expressed by the tag or peer NFC device itself.</li>
      <li>Whether the application has been given additional trust by being
        "installed", ie. added to the home screen.</li>
    </ul>
    The Community Group will also explore the
    possibility of sites registering with the user agent for particular types
    of messages. When multiple registrations are made for a particular type of
    message, a chooser is shown to the user to select among sites to handle the
    available message. Considerations like these could simplify user
    interactions for granting permissions while preserving privacy and security.
    The CG will explore permission systems that allows users to control in a
    clear and concise way the nature of NFC interaction between pages and NFC
    tags or devices. For instance, answering “yes” to a permission dialog for
    using NFC during a read use case must not enable NFC usage in general, and
    particularly must not enable a page to overwrite a writable tag in a way
    the user did not clearly expect. Nor can it mean that a web site can
    initiate a P2P communication with an NFC device which can have effects that
    the user did not intend.
    The Community Group may consider both an API for use by an untrusted
    web site, as well as an enhanced API available to a web site is considered
    trusted.
  </p>
  <p>
    The CG will consider requiring that for riskier API's, the user has agreed
    to allowing a potentially risky or experimental API for a particular trusted
    web site.
    The web site is known through use of HTTPS so some APIs could be restricted
    to use only by known, trusted web sites. The CG could also consider use of
    some APIs only for sites in the local network
    (if permitted by the user). For example, where a device in the local network
    offers a web page (using https), the user could grant that web page
    permissions beyond what normally is allowed for random web pages. That
    would allow for a set of APIs, one safe for any web site and then perhaps
    others that require higher levels of trust and permission.
  </p>
</section>

<section><h3>Out of Scope</h3>
  <p>
    The Community Group will be implemented on top of NFC implementations
    provided by the platform.  Low level NFC specification is out of scope.
  </p>
</section>

<section><h2>Deliverables</h2>
  <section><h3>Community Group Reports that are Specifications</h3>
    <p>
      The CG will define a Web NFC API specification, suitable for use from Web
      Browsers. The CG may also create a specification related to permissions
      and security governing availability or use of APIs.  This could include
      defining particular message content related to permissions and security.
      The CG is free to arrange these specifications into one or more
      specifications for convenience.  However, all Specifications being worked
      on must be clearly indicated on the CG Web page.
      Example of what the specification could look like:
      <a href="http://w3c.github.io/web-nfc/">
      http://w3c.github.io/web-nfc/</a>.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section><h3>Community Group Reports that are not Specifications </h3>
    <p>
      The group MAY produce other Community Group Reports within the scope of
      this charter but that are not Specifications covered by the CLA, for
      instance use cases, permission ceremonies, security hardening reports,
      etc.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section><h3>Test Suites and Other Software</h3>
    <p>
      At present, there are no plans to create a test suite.  If, however, the
      CG decides to develop a test suite, it will be developed in Open Source
      using the W3C Software License.
    </p>
  </section>
</section>

<section><h2>Dependencies or Liaisons</h2>
  <p>
    This group’s specifications have no direct dependencies on any other
    developing specification other than the Web Applications Working Group’s
    Web IDL specification, which many W3C specs depend upon. However, several
    other groups would provide valuable feedback and they will be asked to
    review drafts.

      to ensure they offer the right level of security.
    </dd>
    <dt>Privacy Interest Group</dt>
    <dd>
      The Privacy Interest Group should be asked to review deliverables for
      privacy considerations.
    </dd>
    <dt>Web Cryptography Working Group</dt>
    <dd>
      Interaction with this group would be valuable for the potential synergies
      between work on JavaScript cryptographic APIs and access to secure
      elements on NFC devices.
    </dd>
    <dt>Web Bluetooth Community Group</dt>
    <dd>
      The Web Bluetooth Community Group should be asked to review deliverables
      to take advantage of their general expertise in exposing wireless
      technologies for Web standards. The NFC CG will closely follow the work
      of the Web Bluetooth CG, exploring the similarities of the approach on
      using these technologies by Web pages.
    </dd>
    <dt>Trust and Permissions Community Group</dt>
    <dd>
      The Trust and Permission Community Group may explore the notion of trusted
      web sites, which would allow use of enhanced APIs that are available for
      use only in trusted pages.
    </dd>
    <dt>WAI Protocols and Formats Working Group</dt>
    <dd>
      The WAI Protocols and Formats Working Group should be asked to review
      deliverables in order to ensure the API supports accessibility
      requirements, particularly with regard to interoperability with assistive
      technologies, and inclusion in the deliverable of guidance for
      implementing the group’s deliverables in ways that support accessibility
      requirements.
    </dd>
    <dt>Internationalization Activity</dt>
    <dd>
      The Community Group will ask for reviews to ensure any I18N issues in the
      API are addressed.
    </dd>
    <dt>NFC Forum</dt>
    <dd>
      The NFC Community Group will liaise with the NFC Forum to ensure that the
      W3C NFC API is compatible with the NDEF specifications defined by the
      NFC Forum.
    </dd>
    <dt>ISO and ECMA</dt>
    <dd>
      The NFC Community Group will build upon the capabilities provided by NFC
      related standards developed by ISO/IEC/JTC 1 SC 6 and SC 17, and by Ecma
      International.

    <h2>Community and Business Group Process</h2>

    <p>Terms of in this charter that conflict with those of the Community and
    Business Group Process are void.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Work Limited to Charter Scope</h2>

    <p>The group will not publish Community Group Reports that are
    Specifications on topics other than those described under "Community Group
    Reports that are Specifications" above. See below for how to modify the
    charter. CLA patent provisions apply to Specifications.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Contribution Mechanics</h2>

    <section>
      <h3>Who can make Contributions</h3>

      <p>Contributions can only be made by Community Group Participants (so all
      Contributors have agreed to the CLA). Special care must be taken to
      ensure Contributions of content that is implementable comes from
      Community Group participants.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>How Contributions are made</h3>

      <p>Community Group Participants agree that all Contributions will be
      documented in pull requests and commits for a particular document in the
      group's GitHub repository.</p>

      <p>For Contributions to Specifications, if someone other than the
      Contributor makes the pull request, the pull request MUST indicate who
      the request was made on behalf of and MUST provide a link to the archived
      change request in a GitHub Issue or in the archived Community Group
      contrib or general mail list. This could be a link to archived meeeting
      minutes that clearly indicate who requested changes to a Specification.
      The information MUST be specific enough to easily determine who the
      Contributors were and that the intention was to change a particular
      Specification.</p>

      <p>For software, the GitHub Contributing and License files describes how
      to Contribute and the license under which Contributions are made.</p>
    </section>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Decision Process</h2>

    <p>This group will seek to make decisions when there is consensus. When the
    group discusses an issue on the mailing or Issues list and there is a call
    from the group for assessing consensus, after due consideration of
    different opinions, the Chair should record a decision and any
    objections.</p>

    <p>A common way to determine consensus for important decisions is to
    conduct a Call for Consenus (CfC) where the Chair puts a proposal to the
    group on the public mail list and asks for feedback from the Participants
    within some period of time that is at least 7 days. Not responding
    indicates going along with the proposal. Direct feedback is encouraged,
    especially to weigh the degree of consensus when there is dissent.</p>

    <p>Participants MAY call for an online vote if they feel the Chair has not
    accurately determined the consensus of the group or if the Chair refuses to
    assess consensus. This should be a rare event, only where the usual, less
    formal means of making decisions are not accepted. At least 5 Participants,
    no two from the same organization (or 50% of the organizations and
    individuals, whichever is smaller), MUST agree with the call for a formal
    vote. The call for a vote MUST specify the duration of the vote which MUST
    be at least 7 days and should be no more than 14 days. The Chair MUST start
    the vote within 7 days of the request, or group members MAY start it
    themselves. The decision will be based on the majority of the ballots cast.
    It is the Chair's responsibility to ensure that the decision process is
    fair, respects the consensus of the CG, and does not unreasonably favor or
    discriminate against any group participant or their employer.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Transparency</h2>

    <p>The group will conduct all of its technical work on its The group will
    conduct all of its technical work in public.</p>

    <p>Discussions MAY take place on the group's public mailing list. Other
    discussions MAY take place using Issues in the group's GitHub repository.
    For convenience, GitHub issues and pull requests will be archived to the
    group's contrib list. Other contributions MAY be directly posted to the
    contrib list.</p>

    <p>Meetings MAY be restricted to Community Group participants, but a public
    summary or minutes MUST be posted to the group's public mail list.</p>

    <p>Any decisions reached at any meeting are tentative. Any group
    participant may object to a decision reached at a meeting within 7 days of
    publication of the decision on the mail list. That decision must then be
    confirmed on the mail list by the Decision Process above.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Chair Selection</h2>

    <p>Participants in this group choose their Chair(s) and can replace their
    Chair(s) at any time using whatever means they prefer.</p>

    <p>The following process is used if the less formal process above is not
    acceeptable to group members. If 5 participants, no two from the same
    organization, (or 50% of the organizations and individuals, whichever is
    smaller) call for an election, the group must use the following process to
    replace any current Chair(s) with a new Chair, consulting the Community
    Development Lead on election operations (e.g., voting infrastructure and
    using RFC 2777). Participants announce their candidacies. Participants have
    14 days to announce their candidacies, but this period ends as soon as all
    participants have announced their intentions. If there is only one
    candidate, that person becomes the Chair. If there are two or more
    candidates, there is a vote. Otherwise, nothing changes. Participants vote.
    Participants have 21 days to vote for a single candidate, but this period
    ends as soon as all participants have voted. The individual who receives
    the most votes —no two from the same organization— is elected chair. In
    case of a tie, RFC2777 is used to break the tie. An elected Chair may
    appoint co-Chairs. Participants dissatisfied with the outcome of an
    election may ask the Community Development Lead to intervene. The Community
    Development Lead, after evaluating the election, may take any action
    including no action.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Amendments to this Charter</h2>

    <p>The group MAY decide to work on a proposed amended charter, editing the
    text using the Decision Process described above. The decision on whether to
    adopt the amended charter is made by conducting a 30-day vote on the
    proposed new charter. The new charter, if approved, takes effect on either
    the proposed date in the charter itself, or 7 days after the result of the
    election is announced, whichever is later. A new charter must receive 2/3
    of the votes cast in the approval vote to pass. The group may make simple
    corrections to the charter such as deliverable dates by the simpler group
    decision process rather than this charter amendment process. The group will
    use the amendment process for any substantive changes to the goals, scope,
    deliverables, decision process or rules for amending the charter.</p>
