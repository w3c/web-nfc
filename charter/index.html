        Goals
      </h2>
      <p>
        Near-field communication (NFC) is a form of short range wireless
        communication in which NFC devices such as mobile phones can
        communicate with each other over a typical distance of 4cm or less. NFC
        allows for two way communication. The NFC Forum defines base standards
        for how smart cards are emulated by NFC devices and NFC Forum tags are
        formatted and the protocols for communicating between devices. There
        are three modes of operation:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>read/write mode - the NFC device can read or write records, each of
        which has a type. There are currently several defined record types
        (Text, URI, Smart Poster, etc.). Records can be set to read-only, and
        protected through encryption and digital signatures.
        </li>
        <li>peer to peer mode - where two NFC devices exchange data, for
        example, data for setting up WiFi access, or data representing a
        business card.
        </li>
        <li>card emulation mode - where an NFC device emulates a smart card,
        e.g. allowing an NFC enabled phone to be used for contactless ticketing
        and payment applications. Emulated cards may have limited storage
        capabilities, e.g. the MiFare Classic 1K with 1024 bytes of data
        storage split across 16 sectors.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The main benefit of NFC is the speed and simplicity of operation for
        end users. Touch a card to a reader to pay for ride on the metro. Touch
        an NFC phone to a tag on a poster to view the web site for the
        associated event. Touch two NFC phones together to exchange business
        cards.
      </p>
      <p>
        In some cases no set up is needed as the card's record type is
        recognized by the NFC device's operating system, which automatically
        launches the appropriate application, such as the web browser. In other
        cases, as in peer to peer mode, the device will first need to run the
        corresponding application, which may involve asking the user to select
        what information to share.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Web Near Field Communication Community Group will define an API for
        Web page scripts to use the NFC data exchange format and APDUs,
        enabling a range of use cases for reading, writing, emulating cards and
        data exchange with peer NFC devices. Further background information can
        be found on the NFC Wiki.
      </p>

      <h2 id="scope-of-work">
        Scope of Work
      </h2>
      <p>
        The goal is to provide a Web NFC API that satisfies the most important
        use cases for NFC from Web pages. We believe that means that the API
        will not expose full, low level NFC functionality, but rather a higher
        level subset that is safe for Web pages, protects user privacy, and
        doesn't annoy users with unnecessary or complex permission requests.
      </p>
      <p>
        The scope of the Web Near Field Communications Community Group is
        limited to the development of APIs for Web page scripts to perform the
        following operations with NFC devices:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Reading NDEF messages
        </li>
        <li>Writing NDEF messages
        </li>
        <li>Setting NFC tags to read-only
        </li>
        <li>Peer to peer exchange of NDEF messages between NFC devices
        </li>
        <li>Optionally, manual connection for various technologies, e.g. NFC-A
        and NFC-F
        </li>
        <li>Optionally, initiation of NFC Card emulation mode for NFC devices,
        to allow the use of a device for payments or for unlocking electronic
        door locks.
        </li>
        <li>Optionally, initiation of handover mode to Bluetooth or WiFi
        technology.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The APIs will be designed to permit execution in the Web browser
        context, using the security model of the Web. The very short range of
        NFC devices requires users to make a conscious decision to put one of
        the devices into the appropriate mode and to bring the devices
        physically together, and this should enable a simpler security model
        that minimizes the need for applications to ask for explicit user
        permission. The need for direct user involvement under circumstances
        will need to be explored.
      </p>
      <p>
        The CG will explore permission models that take advantage of the
        physical properties of the NFC connection to align user expectations
        with the permissions actually granted to script. Aspects of the
        environment that might go into the permission model include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Whether the script is running in the frontmost tab or window.
        </li>
        <li>Whether the script is running in an open tab or window (vs. a
        Service Worker)
        </li>
        <li>Whether the script has been vouched for by a trusted authority,
        such as applications installed from a store or shipped with a device.
        </li>
        <li>The user's interactions with permission and choice prompts.
        </li>
        <li>Preferences expressed by the tag or peer NFC device itself.
        </li>
        <li>Whether the application has been given additional trust by being
        "installed", ie. added to the home screen.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The Community Group will also explore the possibility of sites
        registering with the user agent for particular types of messages. When
        multiple registrations are made for a particular type of message, a
        chooser is shown to the user to select among sites to handle the
        available message. Considerations like these could simplify user
        interactions for granting permissions while preserving privacy and
        security. The CG will explore permission systems that allows users to
        control in a clear and concise way the nature of NFC interaction
        between pages and NFC tags or devices. For instance, answering “yes” to
        a permission dialog for using NFC during a read use case must not
        enable NFC usage in general, and particularly must not enable a page to
        overwrite a writable tag in a way the user did not clearly expect. Nor
        can it mean that a web site can initiate a P2P communication with an
        NFC device which can have effects that the user did not intend. The
        Community Group may consider both an API for use by an untrusted web
        site, as well as an enhanced API available to a web site is considered
        trusted.
      </p>
      <p>
        The CG will consider requiring that for riskier API's, the user has
        agreed to allowing a potentially risky or experimental API for a
        particular trusted web site. The web site is known through use of HTTPS
        so some APIs could be restricted to use only by known, trusted web
        sites. The CG could also consider use of some APIs only for sites in
        the local network (if permitted by the user). For example, where a
        device in the local network offers a web page (using https), the user
        could grant that web page permissions beyond what normally is allowed
        for random web pages. That would allow for a set of APIs, one safe for
        any web site and then perhaps others that require higher levels of
        trust and permission.

        <h3>
          Community Group Reports that are Specifications
        </h3>
        <p>
          The CG will define a Web NFC API specification, suitable for use from
          Web Browsers. The CG may also create a specification related to
          permissions and security governing availability or use of APIs. This
          could include defining particular message content related to
          permissions and security. The CG is free to arrange these
          specifications into one or more specifications for convenience.
          However, all Specifications being worked on must be clearly indicated
          on the CG Web page. Example of what the specification could look
          like: <a href=
          "http://w3c.github.io/web-nfc/">http://w3c.github.io/web-nfc/</a>.

        Decision Process
      </h2>
      <p>
        This group will seek to make decisions when there is consensus. When
        the group discusses an issue on the mailing or Issues list and there is
        a call from the group for assessing consensus, after due consideration
        of different opinions, the Chair should record a decision and any
        objections.
      </p>
      <p>
        A common way to determine consensus for important decisions is to
        conduct a Call for Consensus (CfC) where the Chair puts a proposal to
        the group on the public mail list and asks for feedback from the
        Participants within some period of time that is at least 7 days. Not
        responding indicates going along with the proposal. Direct feedback is
        encouraged, especially to weigh the degree of consensus when there is
        dissent.
      </p>
      <p>
        Participants MAY call for an online vote if they feel the Chair has not
        accurately determined the consensus of the group or if the Chair
        refuses to assess consensus. This should be a rare event, only where
        the usual, less formal means of making decisions are not accepted. At
        least 5 Participants, no two from the same organization (or 50% of the
        organizations and individuals, whichever is smaller), MUST agree with
        the call for a formal vote. The call for a vote MUST specify the
        duration of the vote which MUST be at least 7 days and should be no
        more than 14 days. The Chair MUST start the vote within 7 days of the
        request, or group members MAY start it themselves. The decision will be
        based on the majority of the ballots cast. It is the Chair's
        responsibility to ensure that the decision process is fair, respects
        the consensus of the CG, and does not unreasonably favor or
        discriminate against any group participant or their employer.

      <p>
        Any decisions reached at any meeting are tentative. Any group
        participant may object to a decision reached at a meeting within 7 days

        the Community Development Lead on election operations (e.g., voting
        infrastructure and using RFC 2777). Participants announce their
        candidacies. Participants have 14 days to announce their candidacies,
        but this period ends as soon as all participants have announced their
        intentions. If there is only one candidate, that person becomes the
        Chair. If there are two or more candidates, there is a vote. Otherwise,
        nothing changes. Participants vote. Participants have 21 days to vote
        for a single candidate, but this period ends as soon as all
        participants have voted. The individual who receives the most votes —no
        two from the same organization— is elected chair. In case of a tie,
        RFC2777 is used to break the tie. An elected Chair may appoint
        co-Chairs. Participants dissatisfied with the outcome of an election
        may ask the Community Development Lead to intervene. The Community
        Development Lead, after evaluating the election, may take any action
        including no action.

        Amendments to this Charter
      </h2>
      <p>
        The group MAY decide to work on a proposed amended charter, editing the
        text using the Decision Process described above. The decision on
        whether to adopt the amended charter is made by conducting a 30-day
        vote on the proposed new charter. The new charter, if approved, takes
        effect on either the proposed date in the charter itself, or 7 days
        after the result of the election is announced, whichever is later. A
        new charter must receive 2/3 of the votes cast in the approval vote to
        pass. The group may make simple corrections to the charter such as
        deliverable dates by the simpler group decision process rather than
        this charter amendment process. The group will use the amendment
        process for any substantive changes to the goals, scope, deliverables,
        decision process or rules for amending the charter.
